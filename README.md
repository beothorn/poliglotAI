## Complete a task

Using Botecko prompt for characters.
Given one task, you need to ask an AI character to perform an action with certain values.  
Another AI is available to help.  
So for example:  
Language is German.  
Task is order a Margherita pizza.  
The first AI speaks only german, it can call perform the action order_pizza with a String parameter.  
The second AI can speak any language and can help with the task, but not directly.  
Tasks get increasingly more difficult. Issues may arise.  
If the action is correct, the level is clear.  

## Name the objects  
One AI generates an image, another do object recognition and you need to guess/learn the object names.
